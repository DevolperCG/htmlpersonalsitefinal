	<h2>All About Me</h2>
	Hello my name is Cole Glass. I was born in Georgia and have been raised here my whole life. Some of my favorite things to do is play sports, I like to read comics, play games, listen to music and sometimes swimming. I want to try and persue a career in editing and making youtube content for people to laugh and enjoy. I believe editing is very crucial when it comes to making my videos. I want to be known as someone that does stuff creatively and makes people laugh and entertain people. My favorite player of all-time in the NBA would be Michael Jordan you cant compare anybody but Kobe Bryant to him. Shout I dont drink sodas anymore because it used to tear my sleep schudule up alot. Them McDonalds have some electrolites in them to make you either hyper or want another one. I like the walking dead comics even though it can be cruel and also super hero comics are pretty cool to read and look at. I like the site of Atlanta as well and how it looks when you high in the sky or on a tall building.
